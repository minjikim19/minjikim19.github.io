# The problem I saw

Most teams already write meeting notes, but the follow-through is often the weakest link. I wanted a tiny system that could take raw notes and consistently produce clear actions, owners, and deadlines.

## The MVP goal

The MVP had to be fast to use and easy to trust. I scoped it to three core outputs:

- Actions with owners and deadlines
- Risks and open questions
- A short weekly summary

## What worked

I kept the pipeline simple and visible. The app captured notes, ran a single LLM pass, then let people edit the output before it became official.

```text
Notes in -> LLM draft -> human edit -> action log
```

## What I would do next

If I were iterating for a second release, I would add two lightweight improvements:

1. Auto-tag actions by project
2. A reminder view that groups overdue items

The takeaway: a small, reliable workflow beats a complex system that nobody uses.
