# Why these eval habits mattered

Most evaluation plans fail because they are too slow or too abstract. The highest leverage changes were the ones that made review faster without lowering standards.

## Lesson 1: Write a short rubric first

A two-minute rubric keeps reviewers aligned and makes scoring repeatable.

- Include one positive example
- Include one edge case
- Keep the language concrete

## Lesson 2: Track disagreement, not just averages

When scores spread too far, the problem is usually unclear instructions. Disagreement is the signal to fix the prompt or the rubric, not just the model.

## Lesson 3: Close the loop within 24 hours

If fixes land while context is fresh, the same reviewers can validate the improvement. That is how you shorten quality cycles.

> Fast feedback is a feature, not a luxury.

The result was fewer regressions and more confidence in each iteration.
